# <strong>Stack Data Structure</strong>

- Stacks are a LIFO (Last in, First out) Data Structure where the last value in is always the first one out.

- Stacks are used to handle function invocations (the call stack), for operations like undo/redo, and for routing (remember pages you have visited and go back/forward) and much more!

- They are not a built in data structure in Javascript but are relatively simpple to implement.

- You may/can implement them in either using linked list or an array but you should be careful about the pros and cons of using one over the other.

# <strong>Queue Data Structure</strong>

- Queues are a FIFO (First in, First out) data structure, all elements are first in first out.

- Queues are useful for processing tasks and are foundational for more complex data structures.

- Insertion and removal can be done in O(1)

- You should implement this data structure using a linked list since if you'll implement this with an array, you'll have to shift all indexes and that is costy.

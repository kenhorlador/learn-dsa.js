# <strong>Tree Data Structure</strong>

A Data Structure that consists of nodes in a parent / child relationship.

### <strong>What's the difference between lists and trees?</strong>

Lists == Linear <br> Trees == Nonlinear

---

### <strong>Rules</strong>

- A single node can point to one or more nodes.

- A node should only point to its child. It's a parent to child relationship.

- A child should only have one parent.

### <strong>Tree Terminology</strong>

<hr>
- <strong>Root</strong> - The top node in a tree.<br>
- <strong>Child</strong> - A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root.<br>
- <strong>Parent</strong> - The converse notion of a child.<br>
- <strong>Siblings</strong> - A group of nodes with the same parent.<br>
- <strong>Leaf</strong> - A node without any children.<br>
- <strong>Edge</strong> - The connection between one node and another.<br>

### <strong>Uses of Trees</strong>

- HTML DOM (Document Object Model)
- Network Routing
- Abstract Syntax Tree
- Artificial Intelligence
- Folders in Operating Systems
- Computer File Systems

> Note that: There's a lot of varieties of trees.

### <strong>How Binary Search Trees Work</strong>

- Every oarent node has at most <strong>two children</strong>.
- Every node to the left of a parent node is <strong>always less than the parent</strong>.
- Every node to the right of a parent node is <strong>always greater than the parent</strong>.

# <strong>Tree Traversal Algorithm</strong>

Traversal is a process to visit all the nodes of a tree and may print their values too. Because, all nodes are connected via edges (links) we always start from the root (head) node. That is, we cannot randomly access a node in a tree.

I implemented 2 types of Tree Traversals:

1. Breadth First Search and
2. Depth First Search in different orders, namely:

- DFS Pre-order
- DFS Post-order, and
- DFS In-order

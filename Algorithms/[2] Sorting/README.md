# <strong>Sorting Algorithm</strong>

Sorting can be referred to as arranging files in some particular order. The arrangement performed can be based on the value of each file present. That particular order can be in either an ascending or descending fashion. Sorting algorithms are instructions given to a computer to arrange elements in a particular order.

### Sorting algorithms are categorized into:

<strong>1. Internal sorting algorithms</strong> - These are sorting algorithms applied to a small amount of data. Only the main memory is used. Examples would be bubble sort, insertion sort, and quicksort.

<strong>2. External sorting algorithms</strong> - These are sorting algorithms that can be applied to massive amounts of data. As a result, external storage devices such as hard drives, and flash disks are used. An example would be merge sort.
